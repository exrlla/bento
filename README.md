Hello! This is a Nextjs project deployed with Vercel! I created a [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/) clone that replicates the links and CSS from a typical linktr.ee page! 

First, run the development server:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Created for the Codédex Vercel Deployment Tutorial✨
